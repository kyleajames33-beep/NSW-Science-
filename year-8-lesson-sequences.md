# 📘 NSW STAGE 4 SCIENCE PROGRAM
## YEAR 8 – COMPLETE PROGRAM + LESSON SEQUENCES

**Science 7–10 (2023)**
**Implementation:** 2026 onwards
**Curriculum source:** https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/science/science-7-10-2023

## 1. PROGRAM RATIONALE (YEAR 8)

Year 8 Science builds on Year 7 foundations and shifts students toward:

- **systems thinking** (biological, chemical, geological),
- **cause–effect reasoning** driven by energy and structure,
- **disciplined use of data**, models and evidence.

This program deliberately avoids surface learning and prepares students for:

- Stage 5 content depth,
- formal scientific explanations,
- and evaluation of real-world scientific claims.
