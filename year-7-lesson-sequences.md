## 1. PROGRAM RATIONALE

Year 7 Science introduces students to science as a disciplined way of understanding the natural world.

This program develops:

- **Working Scientifically skills** (questioning, investigating, analysing, communicating)
- **foundational understanding** of physical, biological and chemical systems
- **evidence-based reasoning** and scientific literacy

The program avoids rote learning and emphasises cause–effect relationships, structure–function links, and justification using evidence, preparing students for Year 8 and Stage 5 Science.
