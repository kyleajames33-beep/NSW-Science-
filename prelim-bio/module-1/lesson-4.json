        "The endomembrane system (ER, Golgi, lysosomes, vesicles) works as an integrated network for protein/lipid processing and transport",
        "Rough ER makes proteins (with ribosomes), smooth ER makes lipids (no ribosomes)",
        "Golgi modifies and sorts proteins, directing them to correct destinations via molecular tags",
        "Lysosomes digest cellular waste; defects cause lysosomal storage diseases",
        "Vesicles transport materials between organelles via budding and fusion",
        "EXTENSION: Signal sequences (e.g., M6P for lysosomes) act as molecular 'postal codes'"

  "commonErrorsAndRemediation": [
    {
      "error": "Confusing rough ER function ('makes proteins') with Golgi function ('packages proteins')",
      "frequency": "Very common (~40% of students)",
      "remediation": "Use factory analogy consistently: ER = assembly line (makes), Golgi = packaging department (preps for shipping). Emphasize Golgi modifies (doesn't create) proteins."
    },
    {
      "error": "Thinking smooth ER directly builds cell membranes",
      "frequency": "Common (~30%)",
      "remediation": "Clarify: SER makes lipid COMPONENTS (like bricks), Golgi assembles them into membrane STRUCTURES (like building a wall). Vesicles transport components."
    },
    {
      "error": "Believing lysosomes are just 'storage containers' for waste",
      "frequency": "Common (~35%)",
      "remediation": "Emphasize ACTIVE digestion: lysosomes contain enzymes that BREAK DOWN waste into reusable parts. Storage happens BEFORE digestion (in vesicles). Use recycling plant analogy."
    },
    {
      "error": "Drawing vesicles as going only ER → Golgi → membrane (ignoring retrograde transport)",
      "frequency": "Moderate (~25%, mainly extension students)",
      "remediation": "Add arrows showing vesicle recycling in diagrams. Explain membrane conservation: vesicles return to ER to bring back membrane lipids."
    },
    {
      "error": "Confusing 'cisternae' (Golgi) with 'cristae' (mitochondria)",
      "frequency": "Moderate (~20%)",
      "remediation": "Etymology lesson + visual comparison chart. Practice: 'Cristae are CRESTS (folds), cisternae are CISTERNS (flat tanks).' Show side-by-side EM images."
