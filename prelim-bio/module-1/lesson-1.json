Multicellular organisms (plants, animals, most fungi) consist of many specialized cells working together.\n\n**2. The cell is the basic unit of life**\nCells are the smallest units that can carry out all the processes of life. They can obtain nutrients, convert them to energy, carry out specialized functions, and reproduce. Even in multicellular organisms, the cell remains the fundamental functional unit.\n\n**3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells**\nNew cells are produced by division of existing cells. This principle, proposed by Rudolf Virchow, disproved the theory of spontaneous generation (the idea that life could arise from non-living matter). It also explains why all cells share certain common features—they all descended from earlier cells.",

Animal cells don't need cell walls because animals have evolved other structural support systems (internal/external skeletons, extracellular matrix) and require cellular flexibility for processes like cell movement and phagocytosis. The cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (ECM) provide structural support to animal tissues without the rigidity of a cell wall.\n\n**Both Have:**\n• Nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, ribosomes, cytoskeleton, cell membrane",

                "correct": "Correct! The surface area to volume ratio is the key constraint on cell size. As a cell grows larger, its volume increases faster than its surface area (volume increases with the cube of radius, while surface area increases with the square). Since nutrients enter through the surface and wastes exit through the surface, a large cell would struggle to supply its interior with sufficient nutrients and remove wastes quickly enough.

Cell size is limited by the surface area to volume ratio needed for efficient material exchange. Some large cells (like egg cells) divide slowly, and some small cells divide slowly too.",
                  "2": "Incorrect. The amount of DNA in a cell is determined by the organism's genome size, not by cell size. A large cell and a small cell from the same organism contain the same amount of DNA. Also, some very small cells (like some amoebas) have enormous genomes, while some large cells have small genomes.",

While it's true that small cells are easier to view under a microscope, this is a coincidental benefit for scientists, not a biological reason why cells evolved to be small.

It is selectively permeable, allowing some molecules through while blocking others. It also contains receptors for cell signaling.\n\nThe **cell wall** (only in plant cells) provides rigid structural support. Since plants are stationary and don't have skeletal systems, the cell wall gives structural strength to the entire plant. It prevents cells from bursting when water enters by osmosis and allows turgor pressure to build up, which keeps plants upright.\n\nAnimal cells don't need cell walls because:\n• Animals have evolved other structural support systems (internal/external skeletons, extracellular matrix)\n• Animal cells need flexibility for processes like cell movement, phagocytosis, and shape changes\n• The cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (ECM) provide structural support without rigidity\n• Animal tissues and organs are organized differently, with support coming from connective tissues rather than individual cell walls",

          "modelAnswer": "Cell Theory is arguably the most significant unifying principle in all of biology, fundamentally shaping our understanding of life and enabling countless advances in medicine and biotechnology.\n\nThe three principles of Cell Theory are: (1) all living organisms are composed of one or more cells, (2) the cell is the basic unit of life, and (3) all cells arise from pre-existing cells. These principles, developed by Schleiden, Schwann, and Virchow in the 19th century, unified previously fragmented observations about the nature of life.\n\nCell Theory unifies biology by establishing that despite the incredible diversity of life—from bacteria to blue whales—all organisms share the fundamental characteristic of being composed of cells. A bacterium and a human may seem completely different, but both are cellular organisms that share basic cellular features: cell membranes, genetic material, ribosomes, and the ability to carry out metabolism. This common cellular basis explains why all life shares the same genetic code and similar biochemical pathways, supporting the theory of evolution from a common ancestor. It also allows us to study simple organisms like yeast to understand fundamental processes that occur in human cells.\n\nThe practical applications of Cell Theory in modern biology and medicine are extensive. In medicine, understanding that diseases like cancer result from abnormal cell division (violating the controlled aspect of 'cells from pre-existing cells') has led to targeted therapies. Antibiotic development relies on Cell Theory—antibiotics target bacterial cell walls or ribosomes while leaving human cells unharmed because of the structural differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Stem cell therapy exploits the principle that cells arise from other cells, using undifferentiated cells to replace damaged tissues. In biotechnology, genetic engineering works because all cells use the same genetic code, allowing us to insert human genes into bacterial cells to produce insulin.\n\nTechnological advances in microscopy were absolutely crucial to developing Cell Theory. Before Hooke's microscope in 1665, cells were completely invisible to humans. The development of better lenses by van Leeuwenhoek revealed living cells for the first time. Without these technological advances, the patterns observed by Schleiden and Schwann would have been impossible to detect. Even today, advances in microscopy continue to refine our understanding—electron microscopy revealed the ultrastructure of organelles, and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is revealing new details of cellular organization. This demonstrates that scientific progress often depends on technological innovation that allows us to observe previously invisible phenomena.\n\nIn conclusion, Cell Theory's significance cannot be overstated. It provides the unifying framework for all of biology, enables practical applications in medicine and biotechnology, and demonstrates how technological advances drive scientific understanding. Understanding life at the cellular level remains central to modern biology.",
