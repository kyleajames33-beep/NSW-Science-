Where does it go?\n\n**Mystery 2: The Blue Mountains' Blue Haze**\nThe Blue Mountains have a distinctive blue haze that gives them their name. What causes this phenomenon?\n\n**Mystery 3: Sydney Harbour's Glowing Water**\nOn some nights, the water in Sydney Harbour glows an eerie blue when disturbed. What's creating this light?\n\n**Your Challenge**: By the end of this lesson, you'll understand how scientists would investigate these mysteries using evidence-based thinking!"

Evidence: decades of measurements!\n\n**Blue Mountains Haze**: Scientists collected air samples and analyzed light. Eucalyptus trees release oils that scatter blue light. Evidence: atmospheric chemistry and spectroscopy!\n\n**Sydney Harbour Glow**: Scientists sampled the water and found bioluminescent dinoflagellates (Noctiluca scintillans). When disturbed, they emit blue light through a chemical reaction. Evidence: microscopy and chemical analysis!\n\n**The key**: All were solved through systematic observation, measurement, and testing - the scientific method in action!"
