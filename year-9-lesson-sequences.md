---

## PHASE 1: INTERNAL INTELLIGENCE (HOMEOSTASIS)

**Focus:** How the body maintains stability

### Lesson 1: The Balancing Act

**Focus:** Homeostasis introduction & Stimulus-Response Model

**Gamified Activity:** "Thermostat Control" - Students manually control a heater/cooler to keep a virtual room at 22°C while random weather events happen outside

**Key Concept:** Negative Feedback Loops

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Define homeostasis
- Identify stimulus and response in body systems
- Explain negative feedback loops
- Apply homeostasis to temperature regulation

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Homeostasis means "staying exactly the same" (it's dynamic balance within a range)
- Body temperature is always exactly 37°C (it varies slightly)
- Only one system controls each variable (multiple systems coordinate)

---

### Lesson 2: The Surveillance Network

**Focus:** Detecting changes (Receptors & Sense Organs)

**Interactive:** "Wire the Body" - Drag and drop nerves from receptors (eyes, skin, ears) to the brain

**Lab Link:** Reaction Time practical (virtual or physical)

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Identify types of receptors (photoreceptors, thermoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, pain receptors)
- Explain how receptors detect stimuli
- Describe nerve pathways from receptors to brain
- Measure reaction time as indicator of nervous system speed

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Pain is always bad (it's a protective warning signal)
- We have only 5 senses (we have many more: balance, proprioception, temperature, etc.)
- Nerves send messages slowly (nerve signals travel up to 120 m/s!)

---

### Lesson 3: Central Command

**Focus:** The Nervous System (CNS vs PNS) & The Brain

**3D Model:** "Brain Builder" - Students assemble the lobes of the brain and label their functions (e.g., Occipital = Vision)

**Activity:** "Neuron Run" - A mini-game guiding an electrical impulse down an axon

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Distinguish CNS (brain + spinal cord) from PNS (nerves throughout body)
- Identify brain lobes and their functions (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital)
- Describe neuron structure (dendrites, cell body, axon, synapse)
- Explain how electrical signals travel along neurons

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- We only use 10% of our brain (we use all of it, just not all at once)
- Brain damage is always permanent (neuroplasticity allows some recovery)
- Nerves regenerate quickly like skin (nerve regeneration is very slow)

---

### Lesson 4: Chemical Messengers

**Focus:** The Endocrine System

**Analogy:** Nerves are text messages (fast/short); Hormones are letters in the mail (slow/long-lasting)

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Compare nervous system (fast, short-term, electrical) vs endocrine system (slow, long-term, chemical)
- Identify major endocrine glands (pituitary, thyroid, pancreas, adrenals, ovaries/testes)
- Explain how hormones travel via bloodstream to target organs
- Describe hormone functions (growth, metabolism, blood sugar, stress response, reproduction)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Hormones only affect teenagers (hormones regulate body functions at all ages)
- Nervous and endocrine systems work separately (they coordinate closely)
- Hormones cause instant effects like nerves (hormones act slowly over minutes to hours)

---

### Lesson 5: System Failure (Diabetes)

**Focus:** Feedback loops & Blood Sugar regulation

**Error Analysis:** "Fix the Loop" - Students are shown a broken insulin feedback loop and must identify the missing component (Pancreas? Insulin receptor?)

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Explain blood glucose regulation via insulin and glucagon (negative feedback)
- Compare Type 1 diabetes (pancreas produces no insulin) vs Type 2 (cells resist insulin)
- Identify consequences of uncontrolled blood sugar (hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia)
- Describe how feedback loops maintain homeostasis

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Diabetes is caused by eating too much sugar (Type 1 is autoimmune, Type 2 has multiple causes including genetics)
- Only overweight people get diabetes (Type 1 is not weight-related)
- Insulin is a cure (it's management, not cure)

---

## PHASE 2: EXTERNAL THREATS (INFECTIOUS DISEASE)

**Focus:** Pathogens and transmission

### Lesson 6: The Rogue's Gallery

**Focus:** Infectious vs Non-infectious & Types of Pathogens

**Card Sort:** "Friend or Foe?" Sort bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa

**Visual:** Comparing the size/structure of a Virus vs. Bacteria

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Distinguish infectious (caused by pathogens, can spread) vs non-infectious disease (genetic, lifestyle, environmental - cannot spread)
- Compare four pathogen types: bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa
- Identify size differences (viruses smallest, bacteria small, fungi/protozoa larger)
- Understand that not all bacteria/fungi are harmful (many beneficial!)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- All bacteria cause disease (most are harmless or beneficial - gut bacteria, nitrogen fixation)
- Viruses are alive (they're not - need host cells to reproduce)
- Antibiotics kill all germs (only bacteria, not viruses/fungi/protozoa)

---

### Lesson 7: Chain of Reaction

**Focus:** How diseases spread (Direct, Indirect, Vector)

**Simulation:** "The Sneeze" - Visualize droplet spread with/without masks and ventilation

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Identify transmission methods:
  - Direct contact (touching, kissing, sexual contact)
  - Indirect contact (contaminated surfaces, food, water)
  - Droplet (coughing, sneezing)
  - Airborne (particles remain in air)
  - Vector (mosquitoes, ticks, fleas carry pathogen)
- Explain how barriers prevent transmission (masks, handwashing, safe food handling, vector control)
- Apply knowledge to real diseases (COVID-19, influenza, malaria, cholera)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- All diseases spread the same way (transmission varies by pathogen)
- Masks only protect others, not you (quality masks protect both)
- Cold weather causes colds (viruses cause colds; we're just indoors more in winter)

---

### Lesson 8: Outbreak Simulator

**Focus:** Epidemics vs Pandemics

**Game:** "Patient Zero" - Watch a node network turn red as infection spreads. Students apply interventions (Hand washing, Quarantine) to flatten the curve

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Define epidemic (widespread in one region) vs pandemic (worldwide)
- Explain R₀ (basic reproduction number - how many people one infected person infects)
- Identify interventions: quarantine, isolation, social distancing, hygiene, vaccination
- Understand "flattening the curve" (spreading infections over time to avoid overwhelming healthcare)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Epidemic and pandemic mean the same thing (pandemic is global, epidemic is regional)
- Only deadly diseases cause pandemics (severity and spread are different - COVID spread widely, had moderate mortality)
- Herd immunity means everyone is immune (just enough people to protect vulnerable)

---

## PHASE 3: THE DEFENSE SYSTEMS (IMMUNE RESPONSE)

**Focus:** Lines of defense and immunity

### Lesson 9: The Castle Walls (1st & 2nd Line)

**Focus:** Skin, Mucous, Inflammation, Phagocytosis

**Mini-Game:** "Phagocyte Pac-Man" - Play as a Macrophage eating green bacteria blobs

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Describe 1st line of defense (barriers):
  - Skin (physical barrier, slightly acidic, sebum)
  - Mucous membranes (trap pathogens)
  - Stomach acid (kills ingested pathogens)
  - Tears/saliva (contain lysozyme enzyme)
- Describe 2nd line of defense (non-specific cellular):
  - Inflammation (redness, swelling, heat, pain - increases blood flow, brings white blood cells)
  - Phagocytosis (macrophages and neutrophils engulf pathogens)
  - Fever (raises temperature - inhibits pathogen growth, speeds immune response)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Fever is harmful and must always be reduced (mild fever helps fight infection)
- Inflammation is bad (it's a protective response, though chronic inflammation is problematic)
- Skin is just a covering (it's an active immune barrier with antimicrobial properties)

---

### Lesson 10: Special Forces (3rd Line)

**Focus:** Antibodies, B-Cells, T-Cells (Specific Immunity)

**Puzzle:** "Lock & Key" - Match the specific antibody shape to the viral antigen

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Explain 3rd line of defense (specific/adaptive immunity):
  - Antigens (foreign proteins on pathogen surface)
  - B-cells produce antibodies (Y-shaped proteins that bind specific antigens)
  - T-cells (helper T-cells coordinate response, killer T-cells destroy infected cells)
  - Memory cells (remember pathogen for faster response next time)
- Describe lock-and-key specificity (one antibody fits one antigen)
- Explain primary vs secondary immune response (first exposure slow, subsequent exposures fast)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Antibodies kill pathogens directly (they mark them for destruction or neutralize them)
- T-cells and B-cells do the same thing (T-cells coordinate and kill infected cells, B-cells make antibodies)
- Immunity is immediate (takes days for first response, faster for subsequent exposures)

---

### Lesson 11: The Training Ground (Vaccination)

**Focus:** How vaccines work & Herd Immunity

**Simulation:** Adjust vaccination rates (50%, 75%, 95%) and release a virus to see if the vulnerable population survives

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Explain how vaccines work (introduce harmless antigen → immune system creates memory cells → rapid response to real pathogen)
- Identify vaccine types (live attenuated, inactivated, subunit, mRNA)
- Describe herd immunity (when enough people are immune, disease can't spread - protects vulnerable)
- Calculate herd immunity threshold (varies by disease - measles ~95%, COVID ~70-85%)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Vaccines give you the disease (most don't contain live pathogens; side effects ≠ disease)
- Natural immunity is always better (some diseases cause severe complications - vaccination safer)
- Herd immunity means 100% must be vaccinated (percentage varies by disease contagiousness)

---

## PHASE 4: ADVANCED WARFARE (TREATMENT & FUTURE)

**Focus:** Medicine and Technology

### Lesson 12: Nature's Pharmacy

**Focus:** Medicinal plants & Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander knowledge

**Interactive:** "Bush Medicine Walk" - Identify plants like Tea Tree or Emu Bush and their traditional uses

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Recognize Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' extensive medicinal plant knowledge (60,000+ years)

  - Kakadu Plum - highest natural Vitamin C source
  - Emu Bush (Eremophila) - skin infections
- Explain how modern medicines are derived from plants (aspirin from willow bark, morphine from poppies)
- Understand bioprospecting and importance of preserving traditional knowledge

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Traditional medicine is unscientific (many modern drugs originated from traditional remedies)
- All natural remedies are safe (some plants are toxic - dosage and preparation matter)
- Indigenous knowledge is inferior to Western medicine (they're complementary - both valuable)

---

### Lesson 13: Aussie Innovators

**Focus:** Australian medical advances (Spray-on skin, Bionic Ear, Cervical Cancer vaccine)

**Profile:** Creating a "Tech Tree" of Australian inventions

  - Ultrasound scanner (David Robinson & George Kossoff)
- Explain how these innovations work and their global impact
- Recognize Australia's contribution to global health

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Bionic ear makes hearing perfect (it's not natural hearing - brain must learn to interpret signals)
- HPV vaccine only for females (now recommended for all genders - prevents multiple cancers)
- Only scientists in labs make medical advances (clinical doctors, engineers, many disciplines contribute)

---

## PHASE 5: THE FINAL MISSION (ASSESSMENT)

### Lesson 14: Investigation Planning

**Focus:** AT1 Project Prep - "Disease Investigation"

**Tool:** "Investigation Planner" - Scaffolding the research: Cause → Transmission → Symptoms → Prevention

## 🎮 RECOMMENDED APP FEATURES FOR THIS UNIT

### The "Status Bar"
Instead of a normal progress bar, the top of the screen shows **"Host Health: 100%"**. Getting questions wrong drops the health. Students must maintain Host Alpha's health above critical levels.

### The "Pet Pathogen" (Tamagotchi Style)
Unlock a **"Pet Virus"** in Lesson 6. Students have to name it. Paradoxically, keeping it alive helps them understand what pathogens need (warmth, moisture, host) to survive. Students learn optimal conditions for pathogen growth by caring for their pet.

**Educational Value:**
- Temperature requirements
- Moisture needs
- Host dependency
- Nutrient requirements
- Reproduction mechanisms

### The "Antibiotic Error"
In the Error Analysis activity type, present a patient with the **Flu (Virus)** asking for Antibiotics. If the student clicks "Prescribe," they lose XP and get a specific correction explaining:

**Why this is wrong:**
- Antibiotics ONLY kill bacteria (disrupt cell wall synthesis, protein production)
- Viruses have NO cell wall, NO bacterial ribosomes
- Prescribing antibiotics for viruses:
  - Wastes resources
  - Causes side effects (diarrhea, allergic reactions)
  - Contributes to antibiotic resistance (remaining bacteria evolve)
- Correct treatment for flu: Rest, fluids, symptom management (antivirals in severe cases)

### XP Bonus Challenges

**"Outbreak Control"** (Lesson 8):
- Successfully contain outbreak with minimal interventions = +50 XP
- Achieve herd immunity threshold in simulation (Lesson 11) = +100 XP

**"Immunity Speed Run"** (Lesson 10):
- Match all antibodies to antigens in under 2 minutes = +25 XP

**"Medical History Detective"** (Lesson 13):
- Identify all Australian medical innovations on timeline = +75 XP

### ⚠️ Critical Assessment Note
**AT2 (Logbook Investigation)** starts in **Week 2**. Lessons 11 & 12 (Polymers & Biodegradability) concepts must be accessible early via "AT2 Starter Pack" module so students understand what they are investigating while they learn Atomic Theory in class.

---

## PHASE 1: THE BLUEPRINTS (ATOMIC THEORY)

**Focus:** The structure of matter

### Lesson 1: The Atom Builder

**Focus:** Protons, Neutrons, Electrons & Electron Shells

**Gamified Activity:** "Stable or Radioactive?" - Students drag subatomic particles into a nucleus. If the ratio is wrong, it explodes. If it's right, they unlock the element.

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Identify the three subatomic particles: protons (+), neutrons (neutral), electrons (-)
- Explain atomic structure: nucleus (protons + neutrons) with electrons in shells
- Understand atomic number (number of protons) defines the element
- Describe electron shell arrangement (2, 8, 8 pattern for first 20 elements)
- Recognize stable vs unstable isotopes (neutron:proton ratio)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Electrons orbit like planets (they exist in probability clouds/orbitals, not fixed orbits)
- Atoms are mostly solid matter (atoms are mostly empty space - nucleus is tiny compared to electron cloud)
- All atoms of an element are identical (isotopes have different neutron numbers)

**Visual Elements:**
- 3D atom builder interface
- Particle drag-and-drop mechanics
- Stability indicator (glows green for stable, red flash and explosion for unstable)

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Navigate the periodic table structure (periods = rows, groups = columns)
- Distinguish metals (left/center - shiny, conductive, malleable) from non-metals (right - dull, insulators, brittle)
- Identify key groups: Alkali metals (Group 1), Halogens (Group 17), Noble gases (Group 18)
- Recognize periodic trends: reactivity, atomic size, metallic character
- Understand Mendeleev's organization by properties and atomic mass

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Elements are arranged randomly (systematic organization by atomic number and properties)
- All metals are the same (metals have varying reactivity, melting points, density)
- Noble gases never react (they rarely react, but can under extreme conditions)

**Visual Elements:**
- Color-coded periodic table (metals, non-metals, metalloids)
- Falling element blocks with chemical symbols
- Group sorting zones
- Speed increases with level progression

---

### Lesson 3: The Dating Game (Ionic Bonding)

**Focus:** Ions, Cations, Anions, and Ionic Compounds

**Concept:** "The Give & Take" - Students act as "Matchmakers," pairing an electron-giver (Sodium) with an electron-taker (Chlorine) to create a stable couple

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Define ions: atoms that gain or lose electrons to achieve stable electron configuration (full outer shell)
- Distinguish cations (positive ions - metals lose electrons) from anions (negative ions - non-metals gain electrons)
- Explain ionic bonding: electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions
- Write ionic formulas (e.g., Na⁺ + Cl⁻ → NaCl, Mg²⁺ + 2Cl⁻ → MgCl₂)
- Describe properties of ionic compounds: high melting point, brittle, conduct when dissolved/molten

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Ions and atoms are the same (ions have different charge and electron count)
- Metals and non-metals form covalent bonds (metal + non-metal = ionic)
- Ionic compounds conduct electricity as solids (only when dissolved/molten - ions must be mobile)

**Visual Elements:**
- Atom "profiles" showing electron shells
- Electron transfer animation (jumping from metal to non-metal)
- Matching interface with compatibility scores
- Crystal lattice formation visualization

---

### Lesson 4: Co-Parenting (Covalent Bonding)

**Focus:** Non-metal bonding & sharing electrons

**Interactive:** "Molecule Maker" - Connect atoms with "single," "double," or "triple" bond lines to satisfy the octet rule

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Explain covalent bonding: non-metals share electrons to fill outer shells
- Distinguish single bonds (share 1 pair), double bonds (share 2 pairs), triple bonds (share 3 pairs)
- Apply octet rule: atoms want 8 electrons in outer shell (2 for hydrogen)
- Draw simple molecular structures (H₂, O₂, H₂O, CO₂, CH₄)
- Describe covalent compound properties: low melting points, don't conduct electricity, often gases/liquids

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Covalent bonds involve electron transfer (they share, not transfer)
- All bonds are the same strength (single < double < triple bond strength)
- Molecules and compounds are different (molecules are covalent compounds)

**Visual Elements:**
- Atom connection puzzle interface
- Bond-drawing tool (single/double/triple line options)

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Explain metallic bonding: positive metal ions in a "sea" of delocalized electrons
- Describe delocalized electrons: electrons not bound to specific atoms, free to move
- Relate structure to properties:
  - Conductivity (electrons move freely → conduct electricity/heat)
  - Malleability (layers slide past each other without breaking bonds)
  - Luster (electrons interact with light)
  - High melting points (strong metallic bonds)
- Compare metallic vs ionic vs covalent structures

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Metal atoms are bonded like molecules (metallic bonding is different - electron sea model)
- All solids have the same structure (ionic lattices vs metallic structures vs molecular crystals)
- Metals break like ionic compounds (metals bend/deform, ionic compounds shatter)

**Visual Elements:**
- Interactive lattice models (metal ions + electron clouds vs ionic crystal)
- Force application slider
- Deformation animation (metal layers sliding vs ionic bonds breaking)
- Side-by-side comparison view

---

## PHASE 2: EARTH'S INVENTORY (RESOURCES)

**Focus:** Formation of Coal, Oil, and Gas

**Timeline Builder:** Drag events to the timeline to show how plankton turns into oil over millions of years

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Explain fossil fuel formation:
  - Coal: from ancient swamp plants (300 million years ago)
  - Oil & Gas: from marine plankton/organisms (dead organic matter buried, heat + pressure → hydrocarbons)
- Describe time scale: millions of years (non-renewable on human timescales)
- Identify fossil fuel uses: transportation, electricity, plastics, heating
- Recognize Australia's fossil fuel reserves and exports

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Fossil fuels are made from dinosaurs (mostly microscopic organisms - plankton)
- Oil is made from rotting plants/animals on surface (requires burial, heat, pressure over millions of years)
- Fossil fuels are renewable (formation takes millions of years - we use them far faster than they form)

**Visual Elements:**
- Geological timeline (drag-and-drop sequence)
- Depth/pressure/temperature indicators
- Transformation animations (organisms → sediment → fossil fuel)
- Australia map showing coal/gas deposits

---

### Lesson 7: The Combustion Engine

**Focus:** Burning fossil fuels & Chemical Equations

**Lab Link:** "The Candle Jar" - Virtual simulation measuring how long a flame lasts with limited oxygen

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Write combustion equations:
  - Complete combustion: Hydrocarbon + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + Energy
  - Incomplete combustion: Limited O₂ → CO (carbon monoxide) + C (soot) + H₂O + Less energy
- Explain energy release: breaking bonds in fuel releases stored chemical energy
- Identify combustion products and their properties (CO₂ greenhouse gas, CO toxic)
- Understand oxygen requirement for combustion

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Burning creates energy (energy is released, not created - stored chemical energy converted to heat/light)
- Complete combustion always occurs (requires sufficient oxygen - car engines often have incomplete combustion)
- CO₂ is the only combustion product (water vapor also produced, plus CO and soot if incomplete)

**Visual Elements:**
- Virtual candle in jar simulation
- Oxygen level meter (depletes over time)
- Flame height indicator
- Timer showing flame duration
- Equation balancing interface

---

### Lesson 8: The Carbon Cost

**Focus:** Greenhouse effect & Climate change

**Data Task:** Analyze a graph of CO₂ vs Temperature (Direct practice for AT2 Data Analysis)

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Explain greenhouse effect: CO₂ traps heat in atmosphere (radiation in, infrared out, CO₂ absorbs infrared → warming)
- Analyze CO₂ trends: pre-industrial (280 ppm) vs current (420+ ppm)
- Interpret temperature vs CO₂ correlation graphs
- Identify human activities increasing CO₂: fossil fuel combustion, deforestation
- Recognize consequences: global temperature rise, sea level rise, extreme weather, ecosystem disruption

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Climate change and weather are the same (climate = long-term patterns, weather = day-to-day)
- CO₂ is the only greenhouse gas (methane, water vapor, nitrous oxide also contribute)
- Small temperature changes don't matter (2°C global average = massive regional impacts)

**Visual Elements:**
- Interactive graphs (zoom, highlight features)
- Historical temperature/CO₂ data overlays
- Correlation vs causation teaching points
- Data analysis practice questions (AT2 preparation)

---

## PHASE 3: RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (MINING & SUSTAINABILITY)

**Focus:** Extraction and Indigenous perspectives

### Lesson 9: The Extraction (Mining)

**Focus:** Ores, open-cut vs underground mining, refining metals

**Simulation:** "The Mining CEO" - Balance the budget: Extract copper, but digging creates "Waste Rock" and "Pollution." Can you make a profit without ruining the environment meter?

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Define ore: rock containing valuable mineral in high enough concentration to extract profitably
- Compare mining methods:
  - Open-cut: removes surface layers, large scale, cheaper, major land disturbance
  - Underground: tunnels to ore body, smaller surface impact, more expensive, safety risks
- Explain metal extraction: crushing ore → smelting (heating to separate metal) → refining (purifying)
- Identify environmental impacts: habitat destruction, water pollution, air pollution, waste rock
- Describe rehabilitation: restoring mined land (topsoil replacement, replanting)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Mining just digs up pure metal (ore contains metal compounds mixed with rock - must be processed)
- All mining is underground (open-cut is very common for near-surface deposits)
- Mining sites are abandoned after use (modern regulations require rehabilitation)

**Visual Elements:**
- Strategy game interface (resource management)
- Profit meter vs Environment meter (must balance both)
- Visual degradation of landscape (deforestation, erosion)
- Rehabilitation options (costs money but improves environment score)
- Real-world Australian mine examples

---

### Lesson 10: Custodians of Country

**Focus:** Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander use of resources (Ochre, stone, resin)

**Case Study:** "Sustainable Practice" - Compare modern mining rehabilitation with traditional land management practices

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Recognize Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sustainable resource use (60,000+ years without depletion)
- Identify traditional materials:
  - Ochre (iron oxide pigments) - for art, ceremony, skin protection
  - Stone (flint, chert) - for tools, weapons
  - Resin (from spinifex, grass trees) - adhesive for tool-making
  - Bark (paperbark, eucalyptus) - for shelters, containers, canoes
- Understand cultural protocols: taking only what's needed, respecting sacred sites, seasonal harvesting
- Compare traditional sustainable practices vs modern industrial extraction
- Recognize importance of Indigenous knowledge in modern land management

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Indigenous Australians lived without technology (sophisticated technology appropriate to context)
- Traditional practices are "primitive" (highly sophisticated sustainable resource management)
- Mining only became possible with modern technology (Indigenous peoples mined ochre, stone for millennia)

**Visual Elements:**
- Traditional resource map of Australia
- Material samples (ochre colors, stone types)
- Before/after comparison (traditional site vs industrial mine)
- Video/story from Indigenous knowledge holders (with permission)

  - PET (polyethylene terephthalate) - drink bottles
- Describe cross-linking: bonds between polymer chains (makes material stronger/harder)
- Recognize recycling codes (1-7 on plastic products)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- All plastics are the same (different polymers have different properties and recycling)
- Natural materials are always better than synthetic (depends on application and lifecycle)
- Biodegradable plastic disappears instantly (still takes months/years, needs specific conditions)

**Visual Elements:**
- Monomer-to-polymer animation (chain building)
- Polymer chain diagrams
- Cross-linking visualization (3D network formation)
- Recycling symbol decoder
- Physical property comparison (flexible vs rigid polymers)

**AT2 Connection:**
This lesson provides essential background for biodegradability investigation - students need to understand polymer structure to predict breakdown rates.

### Lesson 12: The Forever Trash (Biodegradability)

**Focus:** Direct support for AT2. Decay rates, synthetic vs organic

**Interactive Logbook:** A practice run for their assignment. Record virtual observations of an apple core vs. a plastic bottle over 4 virtual weeks

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Define biodegradable: can be broken down by microorganisms (bacteria, fungi) into natural substances
- Compare decomposition rates:
  - Organic (food, paper): days to months
  - Synthetic polymers (plastics): decades to centuries (PE, PP) or never (some additives)
  - Exceptions: biodegradable polymers (PLA, PHA - require industrial composting)
- Explain factors affecting decomposition:
  - Microorganism presence
  - Oxygen availability
  - Temperature
  - Moisture
  - Material structure (cross-linking, additives prevent breakdown)
- Identify environmental consequences: plastic pollution in oceans, microplastics, wildlife harm

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- All organic materials decompose at the same rate (varies hugely - banana peel vs wood)
- Plastic in landfill decomposes like compost (lack of oxygen/microbes = very slow)
- Recycling solves plastic problem completely (reduces but doesn't eliminate - not all plastic recyclable)

**Visual Elements:**
- Time-lapse comparison (organic vs synthetic decay)
- Virtual logbook template (observation table, photo upload)
- Decomposition factor sliders (temperature, moisture, oxygen)
- Real-world decay timeline infographic (apple 1 month, plastic bottle 450 years)

**AT2 Direct Support:**
- Practice observation recording
- Learn to identify changes over time
- Understand control variables (same conditions for comparison)
- Develop hypothesis about material properties vs decay rate

---

### Lesson 13: Review & Data Analysis

**Focus:** Analyzing the results from AT2

**Error Analysis:** "Spot the bad graph" - Identify missing axes, wrong scales, or incorrect conclusions

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Analyze experimental data: identify trends, patterns, anomalies
- Construct proper graphs:
  - Labeled axes (with units)
  - Appropriate scale (starts at zero or clearly broken)
  - Title describing what's being shown
  - Key/legend if multiple data sets
- Draw evidence-based conclusions (what the data shows, not what you hoped)
- Identify errors in graphs/tables:
  - Missing labels
  - Inconsistent units
  - Misleading scales
  - Unsupported conclusions
- Write scientific explanations linking results to underlying chemistry (polymer structure → decomposition resistance)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Conclusions must match hypothesis (conclusions based on evidence, even if hypothesis wrong)
- Anomalies should be deleted (identify and explain them, don't hide them)
- Correlation proves causation (correlation suggests relationship, need more evidence for causation)

**Visual Elements:**
- Gallery of "good" vs "bad" graphs
- Interactive graph-fixing exercises
- Checklist for scientific reporting
- Sample AT2 logbook with feedback annotations

### 🚨 Critical Timing Note: AT2 Early Access

**The Challenge:**
AT2 (Biodegradability Logbook) starts Week 2, but Polymer lessons (11-12) come at end of unit.

**Solutions:**

**Option 1: AT2 Starter Pack**
- Unlock Lessons 11-12 content early in "Special Missions" menu
- Label clearly: "Complete before starting AT2"
- Shorter versions focusing on essential concepts:
  - What are polymers?
  - Why do plastics not decompose?
  - What affects decomposition rates?

**Option 2: Flip Unit Structure**
- Teach Polymers/Biodegradability first (Weeks 1-2)
- Then go back to Atomic Theory
- Trade-off: loses logical progression (atoms → bonding → materials)

**Option 3: Just-In-Time Learning**
- Week 2: Release "AT2 Investigation Guide" video (10 min)
- Covers polymer basics without full lesson
- Students learn theory (Lessons 11-12) after starting experiment
- Reflection in final report connects theory learned later

**Recommended:** Option 1 (AT2 Starter Pack) - maintains unit flow while providing essential background early.

## PHASE 1: THE PHYSICS OF POWER (ENERGY BASICS)

**Focus:** Forms, Conservation, and Efficiency

### Lesson 1: The Energy Shapeshifter

**Focus:** Transfers vs. Transformations (Kinetic, Potential, Heat, Light)

**Gamified Activity:** "The Rube Goldberg Machine" - Click to place items (dominoes, fans, balls) to transform energy from Potential → Kinetic → Sound

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Identify energy forms: kinetic (movement), gravitational potential (height), elastic potential (stretched/compressed), thermal (heat), chemical (food, fuel), electrical, light, sound, nuclear
- Distinguish energy transfer (moving from one place to another) vs transformation (changing from one form to another)
- Trace energy transformations in systems:
  - Falling ball: GPE → KE → Sound + Heat (on impact)
  - Light bulb: Electrical → Light + Heat
  - Photosynthesis: Light → Chemical (stored in glucose)
- Recognize that all energy ultimately originates from the Sun (except nuclear, geothermal, tidal)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Energy is created when you turn on a light (energy is transformed from electrical, not created)
- Potential energy is only gravitational (elastic, chemical potential also exist)
- Heat and temperature are the same (heat = energy transfer, temperature = average kinetic energy of particles)

**Visual Elements:**
- Rube Goldberg builder interface (drag-drop dominoes, ramps, springs, bells)
- Energy transformation tracker (shows energy form at each stage)
- Animation of energy flow with labeled transformations
- Achievement for creating 5+ transformation chain

---

### Lesson 2: The Law of Conservation

**Focus:** Energy is never created or destroyed

**Simulation:** "Skate Park Physics" - A skater on a ramp. Watch the Potential Energy bar drop as the Kinetic Energy bar rises. Total energy stays constant.

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- State Law of Conservation of Energy: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed or transferred
- Explain energy conservation in systems:
  - Pendulum: KE ↔ GPE (constant total, ignoring friction)
  - Skatepark: At top = max GPE, zero KE. At bottom = max KE, zero GPE. Total constant.
- Identify "lost" energy: not destroyed, transformed to less useful forms (usually heat + sound due to friction/air resistance)
- Understand perpetual motion is impossible (friction always converts useful energy to heat)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Energy "disappears" when things stop moving (it transforms to heat, doesn't disappear)
- Energy is lost to friction (it's not lost, it's transformed to heat - less useful but still energy)
- We can create energy from nothing (violates conservation law - impossible)

**Visual Elements:**
- Interactive skate ramp (adjust height, skater speed)
- Energy bar charts (GPE + KE + Total stacked bars)
- Real-time energy calculation display
- Friction slider (show how total energy decreases over time with friction - energy becomes heat)

---

### Lesson 3: The Efficiency Formula

**Focus:** Useful output vs. Wasted input (Sankey Diagrams)

**Interactive:** "Sankey Slider" - Adjust the efficiency of a car engine. See the "Waste Heat" arrow shrink as the "Motion" arrow grows.

**Math Link:** Calculating Efficiency % = (Useful Energy Output / Total Energy Input) × 100

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Define efficiency: ratio of useful energy output to total energy input
- Calculate efficiency using formula: Efficiency % = (Useful Output / Total Input) × 100
- Interpret Sankey diagrams: arrow width represents energy amount, shows transformation pathways
- Compare efficiencies:
  - Incandescent bulb: ~5% light, 95% heat (very inefficient)
  - LED bulb: ~20-30% light, 70-80% heat (more efficient)
  - Car engine: ~25% motion, 75% heat (inefficient)
  - Electric motor: ~90% motion, 10% heat (very efficient)
- Recognize no device is 100% efficient (some energy always becomes unwanted heat)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Higher power = higher efficiency (power = rate of energy use, efficiency = useful/total ratio - different!)
- Wasted energy is destroyed (it's converted to less useful forms like heat, not destroyed)
- 100% efficiency is possible (friction, heat loss always occur - impossible in real systems)

**Visual Elements:**
- Interactive Sankey diagram (drag efficiency slider, arrows adjust)
- Efficiency calculator (input values, calculates %)
- Real-world device comparisons (side-by-side Sankey diagrams)
- Challenge problems with worked solutions

## PHASE 2: HARDWIRED (ELECTRICITY & CIRCUITS)

**Focus:** Voltage, Current, and Circuitry

### Lesson 4: The Electron Flow

**Focus:** Voltage (Push), Current (Flow), Resistance (Obstacle)

**Analogy:** The "Water Park" - Voltage is the pump height, Current is the water flow, Resistance is the narrow pipe

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Define voltage (V): electrical "pressure" that pushes electrons (measured in volts)
- Define current (I): rate of electron flow (measured in amperes/amps)
- Define resistance (R): opposition to current flow (measured in ohms Ω)
- Apply water analogy:
  - Voltage = water pressure / pump height (pushes water)
  - Current = water flow rate (liters per second)
  - Resistance = narrow pipe (restricts flow)
- Understand Ohm's Law relationship: V = I × R (voltage = current × resistance)
- Identify circuit components: battery/cell (voltage source), wires (conductors), resistors/globes/motors (resistance)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Current is "used up" in circuit (current is constant in series circuit - electrons flow in loop)
- Voltage flows through circuit (current flows, voltage is the push/difference)
- Batteries create electricity (they convert chemical energy to electrical, store energy)

**Visual Elements:**
- Split-screen water park / electrical circuit analogy
- Animated electron flow (dots moving through circuit)
- Adjustable sliders (voltage, resistance) showing effect on current
- Ohm's Law calculator interface

---

### Lesson 5: Circuit Training (Series vs Parallel)

**Focus:** Building circuits

**Simulation:** "The Circuit Sandbox" - Drag and drop batteries, wires, and globes.

**Challenges:**
1. Connect 3 bulbs so if one breaks, the others stay on (Parallel)
2. Make the bulbs as bright as possible (Series Voltage)

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Build series circuits: components in single loop (one path for current)
- Build parallel circuits: components in separate branches (multiple paths)
- Compare series vs parallel:

| Feature | Series | Parallel |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Current | Same through all components | Splits between branches |
| Voltage | Splits between components | Same across all components |
| If one breaks | All stop working | Others keep working |
| Bulb brightness | Dimmer (voltage shared) | Brighter (full voltage each) |
| Total resistance | Adds up (RT = R₁ + R₂) | Decreases (more paths) |

- Draw circuit diagrams using symbols: battery ⎓, globe ⦻, switch ⏚, wire ─
- Recognize household wiring uses parallel (so appliances work independently)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Series is always better / Parallel is always better (depends on purpose!)
- Adding more bulbs in parallel makes them dimmer (they stay same brightness, but drain battery faster)
- Current is used up by first bulb in series (current same throughout series circuit)

**Visual Elements:**
- Drag-and-drop circuit builder (batteries, wires, bulbs, switches)
- Real-time simulation (bulbs light up, brightness changes)
- Current flow animation (electron flow visualization)
- Ammeter/voltmeter tools (measure current/voltage at different points)
- Comparison mode (series and parallel side-by-side)

---

### Lesson 6: Household Spark

**Focus:** Safety, Fuses, and Household wiring

**Error Analysis:** "Inspector Gadget" - Find the hazards in the virtual kitchen (toaster near sink, frayed wire, overloaded power board)

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Identify electrical hazards:
  - Water + electricity (conducts through body → shock/electrocution)
  - Frayed/damaged wires (exposed conductors → shock, fire)
  - Overloaded power boards (exceeds circuit capacity → overheating, fire)
  - Incorrect fuse ratings (too high = won't protect, too low = keeps blowing)
- Explain safety devices:
  - Fuse: thin wire melts if current too high (breaks circuit, prevents fire)
  - Circuit breaker: switch that trips open if current exceeds limit (reusable, faster than fuse)
  - RCD (Residual Current Device): detects current leakage (e.g., through person) → cuts power in milliseconds (prevents electrocution)
  - Insulation: non-conductive covering on wires (prevents shocks)
  - Earth wire: provides safe path for fault current to ground (prevents appliance case becoming live)
- Describe Australian household wiring:
  - 230V AC (alternating current) supply
  - Parallel circuits (appliances work independently)
  - Three-pin plugs: Live (brown), Neutral (blue), Earth (green/yellow stripe)
- Apply safety rules: don't touch electrical with wet hands, don't overload, check for damage, turn off before maintenance

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- DC and AC are the same (DC = constant direction, AC = alternating direction - household is AC)
- Fuses are inconvenient and can be bypassed (fuses save lives and property - never bypass!)
- Earth wire is optional (critical safety feature - conducts fault current safely)

**Visual Elements:**
- Interactive kitchen scene (click to identify 8+ hazards)
- Hazard explanation pop-ups (why it's dangerous, how to fix)
- Circuit breaker animation (shows trip mechanism)
- RCD demonstration (fault current triggers disconnect)
- Wiring diagram of Australian plug (color-coded)

## PHASE 3: THE SOURCE (GENERATION & SUSTAINABILITY)

**Focus:** Where energy comes from

### Lesson 7: Spinning the Turbine

**Focus:** Electricity generation (Magnet + Coil)

**Interactive:** "The Generator" - Spin a magnet inside a wire coil on screen to light up a city. Faster spin = More power.

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Explain electromagnetic induction: moving magnet near wire coil generates voltage (creates current)
- Describe generator operation: rotating magnet inside coil → changing magnetic field → induced current in wire
- Identify common generation method: Energy source → Turbine (spins) → Generator (coil + magnet) → Electricity
  - Coal/Gas/Nuclear: Burn fuel → Heat water → Steam spins turbine
  - Hydro: Falling water spins turbine
  - Wind: Wind spins turbine directly
- Recognize that most electricity generation involves spinning turbines (except solar panels - photovoltaic effect)
- Understand generator output: faster spin = higher voltage, more power

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Electricity is created from nothing in power plants (it's converted from other energy forms - fuel chemical energy, water GPE, wind KE)
- Solar panels have turbines (photovoltaic cells directly convert light to electrical energy - no spinning)
- Generators and motors are unrelated (motor = electrical → kinetic, generator = kinetic → electrical - reverse processes!)

**Visual Elements:**
- Interactive turbine spinner (click-drag to spin, faster = brighter city lights)
- Cutaway generator diagram (rotating magnet, wire coil, magnetic field lines)
- Energy transformation flow chart (fuel → heat → KE → electrical)
- Power output meter (shows voltage/current vs spin speed)

---

### Lesson 8: The Energy Mix

**Focus:** Renewable (Solar, Wind, Hydro) vs Non-Renewable (Coal, Gas, Nuclear)

**Card Sort:** "Power Pros & Cons" - Sort cards like "High Emissions," "Intermittent," "Baseload Power" into the correct energy type

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Compare renewable vs non-renewable:

| Energy Source | Type | Pros | Cons |
|---------------|------|------|------|
| Coal | Non-renewable | Cheap, baseload (24/7), established | High CO₂, air pollution, mining damage, finite |
| Natural Gas | Non-renewable | Lower CO₂ than coal, flexible | Still emits CO₂, finite, fracking concerns |
| Nuclear | Non-renewable (uranium) | Zero emissions, baseload, high output | Radioactive waste, expensive, public fear, finite fuel |
| Solar PV | Renewable | Zero emissions, silent, scalable | Intermittent (night, clouds), storage needed, panel manufacturing impact |
| Wind | Renewable | Zero emissions, cheap per kWh | Intermittent, visual/noise impact, bird deaths |
| Hydro | Renewable | Zero emissions, baseload, storage (pumped) | Dams flood land, ecosystem disruption, limited suitable sites |

- Define terms:
  - Baseload: continuous, reliable power (coal, nuclear, hydro)
  - Intermittent: variable output depending on conditions (solar, wind)
  - Greenhouse gas emissions: CO₂, methane released (warming atmosphere)
- Recognize need for energy mix: balance reliability, cost, environmental impact
- Understand storage importance for renewables: batteries, pumped hydro store excess energy for when intermittent sources aren't producing

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Renewable energy is always better (location, storage, materials all matter - complex trade-offs)
- Nuclear power always causes disasters (extremely rare, modern designs very safe, statistically safer than coal)
- Solar/wind can replace fossil fuels immediately (storage, grid stability challenges - transition takes decades)

**Visual Elements:**
- Interactive card sorting (drag pros/cons to correct energy source)
- Energy source comparison table (emissions, cost, reliability scores)
- Australia's energy mix pie chart (current vs 2030 target vs 2050 target)
- Photo gallery (coal plant, wind farm, solar panels, nuclear reactor, dam)

### Lesson 9: Australia's Grid

**Focus:** The transition to renewables and "The Case for Change"

**Debate Mode:** "Town Hall Meeting" - Choose a side (Coal Miner vs Solar Developer) and select the best arguments to win the debate

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Describe Australia's current energy mix: ~60% coal, ~20% gas, ~20% renewables (2024 data - varies by state)
- Identify Australia's renewable advantages: abundant sunlight (solar), coastal winds, rooftop solar leadership (highest per capita globally)
- Explain transition challenges:
  - Grid stability (coal provides baseload, renewables intermittent)
  - Energy storage (batteries expensive, pumped hydro limited sites)
  - Transmission (renewable sources often remote, need new transmission lines)
  - Social: job losses in coal regions, need for retraining
- Recognize Australia's 2030 target: 82% renewable electricity
- Understand different stakeholder perspectives:
  - Coal workers: jobs, community survival, energy security concerns
  - Renewable sector: job creation, climate action, health benefits (less air pollution)
  - Scientists: urgent climate action needed
  - Economists: falling renewable costs, stranded fossil fuel assets

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Transition is only about environment (also economics, jobs, technology, politics)
- Renewables will cost more (solar/wind now cheaper per kWh than new coal/gas - batteries still expensive)
- Coal miners will all lose jobs (some repurposing possible, but transition support critical)

**Visual Elements:**
- Debate interface (choose character, select arguments, counter-arguments)
- Argument strength meter (evidence-based arguments score higher)
- Australia energy map (showing coal plants, wind farms, solar installations, proposed projects)
- Timeline graphic (2024 mix → 2030 target → 2050 net zero)
- Job transition infographic (coal sector jobs vs renewable sector growth)

**Exam Preparation Note:**
This is Lesson 9 - the last content lesson before Week 8 Exam. All examinable content (Lessons 1-9) now covered.

---

## PHASE 4: THE FINAL BUILD (ENERGY EFFICIENT HOUSING)

**Focus:** Thermodynamics and the Capstone Project

*These lessons (10-12) occur AFTER the Week 8 Exam, preparing students for the Week 9-10 Energy Efficient House Design Project*

### Lesson 10: Heat Moves (Thermodynamics)

**Focus:** Conduction, Convection, Radiation

**Simulation:** "Thermal Vision" - View a house through a thermal camera. Spot the red (heat loss) zones at windows and gaps.

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Define heat transfer: energy moving from hot objects to cold objects
- Explain three heat transfer methods:

  **CONDUCTION:**
  - Heat through direct contact (particle to particle)
  - Solids: particles vibrate, energy transfers to neighbors
  - Metals conduct well (free electrons carry heat)
  - Insulators conduct poorly (trapped air, no free electrons)
  - Example: Metal spoon gets hot in hot water, wooden spoon doesn't

  **CONVECTION:**
  - Heat through fluid (liquid/gas) movement
  - Hot fluid less dense → rises. Cool fluid more dense → sinks.
  - Creates circulation currents
  - Example: Hot air rises from heater, cool air sinks to floor (convection current)

  **RADIATION:**
  - Heat through electromagnetic waves (infrared)
  - Doesn't need particles (works in vacuum)
  - All objects emit radiation (hotter = more radiation)
  - Dark surfaces absorb/emit better than shiny surfaces
  - Example: Sun's heat reaches Earth through space (radiation)

- Apply to houses:
  - Conduction: heat through walls, windows (solid materials)
  - Convection: warm air escaping through gaps, cold drafts entering
  - Radiation: sun heating house through windows, heat radiating from walls at night
- Identify heat loss areas: windows (conduction + radiation), gaps/cracks (convection), thin walls/roofs (conduction)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Heat and cold flow (only heat flows - cold is absence of heat)
- Insulation creates heat (it slows heat transfer, doesn't generate heat)
- Radiation only comes from the sun (all objects radiate - amount depends on temperature)

**Visual Elements:**
- Thermal camera view of house (color-coded heat zones: red = hot, blue = cold)
- Click hotspots to see heat loss explanations
- Three animations side-by-side (conduction, convection, radiation with particle/fluid/wave visualization)
- Heat transfer rate comparison (metal vs wood, still air vs moving air, dark vs shiny surfaces)

### Lesson 11: Passive Solar Design

**Focus:** Orientation, Eaves, and Thermal Mass

**Interactive:** "Sun Tracker" - Rotate a virtual house to face North. Adjust the eave overhang to block summer sun but let in winter sun.

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Explain passive solar design: using sun's energy for heating/lighting without mechanical systems
- Apply design principles in Southern Hemisphere (Australia):

  **ORIENTATION:**
  - Face main windows NORTH (maximum sun exposure)
  - North = sun path (sun travels east → north → west in Australia)
  - Minimize west windows (harsh afternoon sun in summer)

  **EAVES/SHADING:**
  - Eave overhang calculated for latitude
  - Summer: high sun angle (blocked by eaves → shade)
  - Winter: low sun angle (enters under eaves → warmth)
  - Rule of thumb: eave depth ≈ 45° angle

  **THERMAL MASS:**
  - Heavy materials (concrete, brick, tiles) absorb heat during day, release at night
  - Stabilizes temperature (cooler in day, warmer at night)
  - Place in sunlight (north-facing) for maximum effect
  - Light materials (timber, plasterboard) don't store heat

  **VENTILATION:**
  - Cross-ventilation: windows on opposite sides allow breeze through
  - High windows: hot air escapes (stack effect)
  - Night purge: open windows at night to cool thermal mass

- Calculate eave depth for sun angle: depth = window height / tan(sun altitude angle)
- Recognize climate variations: tropical needs more shading, temperate balance, cold prioritizes winter sun capture

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- Passive solar works everywhere the same (climate/latitude variations critical)
- Big windows always mean more solar gain (north windows gain, west/east can overheat)
- Thermal mass is insulation (opposite - mass stores/releases heat, insulation prevents heat flow)

**Visual Elements:**
- Interactive house rotator (360° view, compass showing north)
- Sun path simulator (shows summer vs winter sun angle)
- Eave adjustment slider (see shadow change by season)
- Thermal mass demonstration (side-by-side: brick vs timber interior temperature graphs)
- Climate zone selector (tropical, temperate, cold - different optimal designs)

---

### Lesson 12: The Insulation Challenge

**Focus:** Materials (R-Value) and Double Glazing

**Project Prep:** This lesson directly feeds into the "Energy Efficient House" project (Weeks 9-10)

**Duration:** 20-25 minutes

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Define insulation: material that reduces heat transfer (slows conduction)
- Explain R-value: resistance to heat flow (higher = better insulation)
  - Units: m²·K/W (area × temperature difference / watts)
  - Common ranges: R1.5 (thin batts), R6.0 (thick ceiling batts), R10+ (extreme insulation)
- Compare insulation materials:

  | Material | R-value (per 100mm) | Pros | Cons |
  |----------|---------------------|------|------|
  | Air (still) | ~R2.5 | Free | Hard to trap (convection) |
  | Fiberglass batts | ~R2.5-3.0 | Cheap, common | Skin irritant, sags over time |
  | Polyester batts | ~R2.5 | Non-itchy, recyclable | Slightly more expensive |
  | Foam (polyurethane) | ~R4.0-5.0 | High R-value | Expensive, chemicals |
  | Reflective foil | ~R0.5-1.0 | Reflects radiation, cheap | Low R-value alone (use with air gap) |

- Understand insulation location priorities:
  1. Ceiling (hot air rises - highest heat loss in winter, gain in summer)
  2. Walls
  3. Floor (if above ground/crawl space)
- Explain double glazing: two glass panes with air/gas gap between
  - Single glass: ~R0.15 (poor insulator)
  - Double glazed: ~R0.3-0.4 (2x better)
  - Bonus: reduces condensation, noise
- Recognize energy star ratings for appliances: more stars = more efficient (saves running cost)

**Misconceptions to Address:**
- More insulation always better (diminishing returns - R6 to R7 adds little benefit for cost, R1 to R2 adds lots)
- Insulation keeps heat out AND in (yes! Slows heat flow in both directions - cool in summer, warm in winter)
- Reflective foil is sufficient alone (needs air gap to work - reflects radiation but doesn't resist conduction)

**Visual Elements:**

### The "Circuit Breaker" Minigame

A fast-reaction game where electrons (dots) flow down a wire. Students must tap to "open the switch" before a power surge (red dot) hits the sensitive component.

**Game Mechanics:**
- Blue dots = normal current (safe, don't interrupt)
- Red dot = power surge (dangerous, must stop!)
- Tap switch = opens circuit (stops all flow)
- If red dot reaches component: -50 XP, "Component Damaged!"
- If you stop red dot in time: +25 XP, "Protected!"
- But if you open circuit unnecessarily (blue dots only): -10 XP, "False Alarm!"

**Difficulty Progression:**
- Level 1: Slow speed, infrequent surges
- Level 5: Fast speed, multiple wires, frequent surges
- Level 10: Must distinguish voltage surge vs current surge (different colored threats)

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Reinforces circuit breaker function (protect from excess current)
- Teaches speed is critical (surges happen fast - milliseconds)
- Shows trade-off: too sensitive = nuisance trips, too slow = damage occurs

## LESSON SEQUENCE – UNIT 4 (WAVES AND MOTION)

### 📐 PHASE 1: MOTION FUNDAMENTALS (Lessons 1-3)

Focus: Understanding speed, velocity, acceleration, and motion graphs

---

### **L1: Speed vs Velocity**

**Focus:**
The difference between speed (scalar) and velocity (vector), calculating average speed, understanding that direction matters.

**🎬 Stunt Lab Context:**
Car chase scene — two cars with same speed but different velocities (one going north, one going in circles). Which stunt driver is easier to predict?

**Key Activities:**
- **Prediction Challenge:** If two cars travel 100 m in 10 seconds, are they doing the same thing? (No — could be different paths/directions)
- **Simulation:** Race timer vs GPS tracker — calculate speed from distance/time, plot velocity vectors
- **Error Analysis:** Student's lab report claims "the car accelerated from 5 m/s to 15 m/s" but they only measured total distance and time (can't know if acceleration occurred)

**Outcomes:**
- Define speed as distance/time
- Distinguish between speed (magnitude only) and velocity (magnitude + direction)
- Calculate average speed using s = d/t

**Misconceptions:**
- Speed and velocity are the same thing
- Average speed = instantaneous speed at all times
- Fast-moving objects are always accelerating

**Visual:**
- Split screen: Car A (straight line) vs Car B (zigzag path)
- Speed vs velocity vector diagrams

**App Feature:**
- **Formula Triangle Tool** unlocks (shows d, s, t triangle — cover unknown to find formula)

**XP Bonus Challenge:**
- Design a car chase where villain appears faster (higher speed) but hero reaches destination first (better velocity direction) = +100 XP

---

### **L2: Acceleration**

**Focus:**
Understanding acceleration as change in velocity over time, calculating acceleration, recognizing deceleration.

**🎬 Stunt Lab Context:**
Motorcycle jump ramp — how quickly must the bike accelerate to reach takeoff speed? How much braking force after landing?

**Key Activities:**
- **Prediction Challenge:** Bike needs to reach 20 m/s to clear the gap. If it starts at 5 m/s and has 30 m of ramp, will it make it? (Need to know acceleration)
- **Simulation:** Adjust ramp length and engine power to achieve safe jump
- **Error Analysis:** Student calculates acceleration using initial and final position (not initial and final velocity)

**Outcomes:**
- Define acceleration as change in velocity over time
- Calculate acceleration using a = (v - u)/t
- Interpret negative acceleration as deceleration

**Misconceptions:**
- Acceleration only means speeding up (not direction change or slowing down)
- Acceleration = velocity
- Objects at constant velocity are accelerating
- Acceleration and speed are the same thing

**Visual:**
- Velocity-time graph showing positive slope (acceleration), flat line (constant velocity), negative slope (deceleration)

**App Feature:**
- **Slow-Mo Replay** mode (tap any simulation to see frame-by-frame velocity changes)

**XP Bonus Challenge:**
- Design stunt with 3 acceleration phases (speed up, constant, slow down) that meets exact time and distance constraints = +125 XP

---

### **L3: Motion Graphs**

**Focus:**
Interpreting and constructing distance-time and velocity-time graphs, understanding gradients and areas under curves.

**🎬 Stunt Lab Context:**
Parkour chase sequence — director wants runner to "pause dramatically on the rooftop" then "burst into a sprint" — translate this into a motion graph.

**Key Activities:**
- **Prediction Challenge:** Show distance-time graph with flat section — what's happening in the stunt? (Standing still? Moving at constant speed backwards to starting point? Not enough info)
- **Simulation:** Graph Builder — drag motion description tiles onto graph to build correct shape
- **Error Analysis:** Student claims "steep slope on distance-time graph = high acceleration" (actually just high speed)

**Outcomes:**
- Interpret distance-time graphs (gradient = speed)
- Interpret velocity-time graphs (gradient = acceleration, area under curve = distance)
- Construct motion graphs from written descriptions

**Misconceptions:**
- Graph shape shows the path traveled (not motion data)
- Steep slope always means acceleration
- Distance-time and velocity-time graphs are the same
- Flat line on distance-time graph means object is moving slowly (it's stationary)
- Negative section on graph means moving backwards in time

**Visual:**
- Side-by-side comparison of same motion: video, distance-time graph, velocity-time graph
- Annotated graph showing "gradient = ...", "area = ..."

**App Feature:**
- **Graphing Canvas** (draw your own motion graph, app generates animation of stunt)

**XP Bonus Challenge:**
- Create motion graph that matches Hollywood director's 5-sentence description perfectly (zero errors) = +100 XP

### 📐 PHASE 2: WAVE PROPERTIES (Lessons 4-7)

Focus: Understanding wave behavior, properties, and types

---

### **L4: Wave Basics**

**Focus:**
Parts of a wave (crest, trough, amplitude, wavelength, frequency), transverse vs longitudinal waves.

**🎬 Stunt Lab Context:**
Ocean wave stunt — surfer needs waves with specific height and frequency for safe stunt. How do we measure and describe waves?

**Key Activities:**
- **Prediction Challenge:** Two waves: Wave A has high crests but low frequency; Wave B has low crests but high frequency. Which delivers more energy to the surfer? (B — frequency matters more)
- **Simulation:** Wave Generator — adjust amplitude and frequency sliders, observe effect on energy
- **Error Analysis:** Student measures wavelength from crest to trough (should be crest to crest)

**Outcomes:**
- Label parts of a wave (crest, trough, amplitude, wavelength)
- Define frequency as number of waves per second
- Distinguish transverse (perpendicular) and longitudinal (parallel) waves

**Misconceptions:**
- Amplitude and wavelength are the same thing
- Wavelength is measured vertically
- All waves are transverse
- Frequency = speed
- Higher amplitude = higher frequency

**Visual:**
- Annotated transverse wave diagram
- Side-by-side: transverse (water) vs longitudinal (sound) wave animations

**App Feature:**

---

### **L5: Sound Waves**

**Focus:**
Sound as a longitudinal wave, pitch (frequency) vs volume (amplitude), speed of sound, echoes.

**🎬 Stunt Lab Context:**
Explosion scene — sound designer needs to know how far away to place microphones so explosion sound and flash arrive at same time on camera.

**Key Activities:**
- **Prediction Challenge:** Lightning and thunder — if you see the flash and hear the thunder 3 seconds later, how far away was the lightning? (speed of sound = 340 m/s)
- **Simulation:** Thunder Distance Calculator — adjust lightning distance, calculate delay
- **Error Analysis:** Student claims "higher pitch = louder sound" (confusing frequency and amplitude)

**Outcomes:**
- Describe sound as longitudinal wave (compressions and rarefactions)
- Relate pitch to frequency, volume to amplitude
- Calculate distance using speed of sound (340 m/s in air)

**Misconceptions:**
- Sound is a transverse wave
- Pitch and volume are the same thing
- Sound and light travel at the same speed
- Sound can travel through vacuum ("in space, everyone can hear you scream")
- Echoes are "new sounds" not reflections

**Visual:**

---

### **L6: Light and the Electromagnetic Spectrum**

**Focus:**
Light as a transverse wave, electromagnetic spectrum (radio to gamma), different EM waves have different properties and uses.

**🎬 Stunt Lab Context:**
Night vision chase scene — which part of EM spectrum do night vision goggles detect? Why do we film explosions with high-speed infrared cameras?

**Key Activities:**
- **Prediction Challenge:** Rank EM waves by danger level to humans (gamma > X-ray > UV > visible > infrared > microwave > radio)
- **Simulation:** EM Spectrum Explorer — click each wave type to see uses and hazards
- **Error Analysis:** Student claims "infrared is hotter than visible light because it's called 'heat radiation'" (energy depends on intensity, not type)

**Outcomes:**
- Order EM spectrum from long wavelength (radio) to short wavelength (gamma)
- Link wave type to uses (e.g., UV kills bacteria, X-rays for medical imaging)
- Recognize that all EM waves travel at speed of light in vacuum (3 × 10⁸ m/s)

**Misconceptions:**
- Only visible light is "real light"
- UV is hotter than infrared (confusing wavelength with energy intensity)
- X-rays and gamma rays are fundamentally different (both are high-energy EM waves)
- Radio waves are sound waves
- Microwaves cook food "from the inside out"

**Visual:**
- EM spectrum diagram with wavelength scale, frequency scale, uses, and hazards
- Comparative wave illustrations (long radio waves vs tiny gamma waves)

**App Feature:**
- **Spectrum Scanner** (point phone at objects to "detect" which EM waves they emit/reflect)

**XP Bonus Challenge:**
- Design spy gadget that uses 3 different parts of EM spectrum with scientifically accurate justification = +150 XP

---

### **L7: Reflection and Refraction**

**Focus:**
Law of reflection (angle in = angle out), refraction (bending of light), real vs apparent depth.

**🎬 Stunt Lab Context:**
Mirror maze stunt — design escape route using angle of reflection. Underwater scene — actor appears to be 1 m down but is actually 1.3 m down (refraction tricks camera).

**Key Activities:**
- **Prediction Challenge:** Shine laser at mirror at 30° angle — where will it reflect? (30° on other side of normal)
- **Simulation:** Mirror Maze Solver — trace light path using law of reflection to hit target
- **Error Analysis:** Student claims "light bends away from the normal when entering water" (bends toward normal when slowing down)

**Outcomes:**
- State law of reflection: angle of incidence = angle of reflection
- Explain refraction as change in wave speed causing direction change
- Recognize that refraction makes underwater objects appear shallower

**Misconceptions:**
- Light always travels in straight lines (ignores refraction)
- Reflection and refraction are the same thing
- Light bends randomly when hitting water
- Mirrors flip left and right (they flip front and back)
- Refraction only happens with light (happens with all waves)

**Visual:**
- Ray diagrams showing incident ray, reflected ray, normal line, angles
- Refraction diagram: light ray bending at air-water boundary
- Real vs apparent depth illustration (fish appears higher than it is)

**App Feature:**
- **Laser Angle Tool** (draw ray diagrams, app checks angles automatically)

**XP Bonus Challenge:**

### 📐 PHASE 3: INTEGRATION & ASSESSMENT (Lessons 8-10)

---

### **L8: Wave-Motion Connections**

**Focus:**
Wave speed equation (v = f × λ), connecting motion concepts (speed, distance) to wave concepts (frequency, wavelength).

**🎬 Stunt Lab Context:**
Stadium wave (human wave) — can we predict how fast it will travel around the stadium? (Yes — if we know wavelength and frequency)

**Key Activities:**
- **Prediction Challenge:** Ocean waves have wavelength 10 m and frequency 0.5 Hz — how fast are they moving? (v = f × λ = 5 m/s)
- **Simulation:** Wave Speed Calculator — adjust f and λ sliders, observe wave speed
- **Error Analysis:** Student uses v = d/t formula for waves but measures amplitude instead of wavelength

**Outcomes:**
- Use wave equation v = f × λ
- Relate wave speed to motion concepts (distance/time)
- Rearrange wave equation to find frequency or wavelength

**Misconceptions:**
- Wave speed = amplitude
- Frequency and wavelength are independent of speed
- Wave equation only works for water waves (works for all waves)

**Visual:**
- Formula triangle (v, f, λ)
- Animated demonstration: high frequency + short wavelength = high speed

**App Feature:**
- **Wave Speed Calculator** (built into Formula Triangle Tool)

**XP Bonus Challenge:**
- Solve 5 wave speed problems using all three formula variations (find v, find f, find λ) = +75 XP
