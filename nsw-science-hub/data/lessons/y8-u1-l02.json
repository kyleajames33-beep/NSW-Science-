CELLS** (smallest living unit)\n• Function: Basic life processes (respiration, make proteins, reproduce)\n• Limitation: Too small/weak for complex tasks alone\n• Example: Single muscle cell can contract, but barely moves anything\n\n**2. TISSUES** (groups of SIMILAR cells working together)\n• Function: SPECIALIZED GROUP tasks\n• Types:\n  - Muscle tissue: Contraction and movement\n  - Nervous tissue: Communication via electrical signals\n  - Epithelial tissue: Covering/protection/absorption\n  - Connective tissue: Support, connect, transport\n• Advantage: COOPERATION makes cells stronger/more effective\n• Example: Millions of muscle cells → muscle tissue that can lift heavy objects\n\n**3. ORGANS** (DIFFERENT tissue types combined)\n• Function: COMPLEX, MULTI-STEP tasks\n• Structure: 2+ tissue types working together\n• Advantage: Combination of different tissues → sophisticated functions\n• Example: Heart\n  - Cardiac muscle tissue (contracts to pump)\n  - Nervous tissue (controls rhythm)\n  - Connective tissue (valves, structure)\n  - Epithelial tissue (inner lining of chambers)\n  → Together: Rhythmic, controlled pumping that individual tissues can't do!\n\n**4. ORGAN SYSTEMS** (multiple organs working together)\n• Function: BODY-WIDE coordination\n• Structure: Several organs with related functions\n• Advantage: Division of labor, efficiency, redundancy\n• Example: Digestive system\n  - Mouth (mechanical breakdown)\n  - Stomach (chemical + mechanical digestion)\n  - Small intestine (absorption)\n  - Liver (produces digestive chemicals)\n  - Pancreas (produces enzymes)\n  → Together: Complete nutrient processing from food → usable molecules\n\n**5. ORGANISM** (all systems working together)\n• Function: COMPLETE LIVING BEING\n• Structure: 11 major organ systems (circulatory, respiratory, digestive, nervous, muscular, skeletal, immune, endocrine, excretory, reproductive, integumentary)\n• Advantage: Fully functional, independent life\n\n**WHY HIERARCHY MATTERS:**\n\n✓ **Specialization**: Each level allows more specialized functions\n✓ **Division of Labor**: Different parts handle different jobs\n✓ **Efficiency**: Grouped specialists work better than generalists\n✓ **Resilience**: If some cells die, tissue still functions (redundancy)\n✓ **Complexity**: Enables sophisticated behaviors (thinking, running, healing)\n\n**Bottom-Up Emergence:**\nSimple components (cells) → Organized into groups (tissues) → Combined in structures (organs) → Coordinated in systems → Create emergent properties (consciousness, healing, growth) that NO SINGLE CELL possesses!\n\nThat's how 37 trillion cells become YOU!",
