Science needs actual evidence!'\n\n**Why Jordan was RIGHT:**\n\n❌ **Alex's Mistake (Non-Scientific Thinking):**\n• 'Red cars are faster' - NO EVIDENCE provided, just a claim\n• Car color is PAINT - it doesn't affect engine power, aerodynamics, or speed\n• Calling something a 'scientific fact' doesn't make it one - you need TESTING!\n• This is like saying 'people in red shirts run faster' - sounds absurd when you think about it!\n\n✅ **Jordan's Scientific Thinking:**\n• Recognized the claim needs EVIDENCE, not just assertion\n• Understood science requires TESTING: measure actual speeds of red vs blue cars (same model, same conditions)\n• Knew that claims must be VERIFIABLE - others can check your results\n• Science doesn't accept claims just because someone says so!\n\n**The Reality Check:**\nIf you actually tested this scientifically:\n1. Take 100 red cars and 100 blue cars of the SAME MODEL\n2. Test their 0-60mph acceleration on a track\n3. Compare the results\n\n**Outcome**: NO DIFFERENCE! The color of paint has ZERO effect on speed. Car performance depends on engine, weight, aerodynamics - not color!\n\n**The KEY Lesson:**\nScience demands EVIDENCE through measurement and testing. Claims without evidence - even if they sound confident or use the word 'science' - are just opinions!\n\n**The Three Pillars in Action:**\n• MEASURABLE? Yes - we can measure car speeds with instruments\n• TESTABLE? Yes - we CAN design experiments to test this\n• VERIFIABLE? When tested, everyone gets the same result: color doesn't affect speed!\n\nThat's evidence-based thinking! 🔬"
