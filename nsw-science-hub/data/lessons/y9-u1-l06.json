Started feeling sick 2 days ago.\n\n**Person B:** Has diabetes (manages blood sugar with insulin). Has had this condition for 10 years.\n\n**The Question:** You don't want to get sick.

          "explanation": "**Correct Answer: Person A (cold)**\n\nThe key distinction is between:\n\n**INFECTIOUS diseases:**\n- Caused by PATHOGENS (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa)\n- CAN spread from person to person\n- Examples: Cold, flu, COVID-19, tuberculosis, athlete's foot, malaria\n\n**NON-INFECTIOUS diseases:**\n- Caused by genetics, lifestyle, or environmental factors (NOT pathogens)\n- CANNOT spread from person to person\n- Examples: Diabetes, cancer, asthma, heart disease, arthritis\n\n**Person A has a cold (caused by a virus)** → infectious → you can catch it through droplets when they sneeze\n\n**Person B has diabetes (caused by genetic/lifestyle factors)** → non-infectious → you cannot \"catch\" it from them\n\n**The air conditioning myth:** Air conditioning doesn't kill germs (though HEPA filters can help trap some particles). Diseases spread through direct/indirect contact, droplets, or airborne particles.",
