Your brain interprets WHICH receptors sent the signal to determine WHAT you sensed.\n\n**Example:**\n- Light hits photoreceptors \u2192 electrical signal \u2192 brain interprets as 'vision'\n- Sound vibrates mechanoreceptors \u2192 electrical signal \u2192 brain interprets as 'hearing'\n- Same signal type, different interpretation based on source!",

After a minute, you don't feel it anymore \u2014 receptors have ADAPTED. This prevents sensory overload.\n\n**Fast-adapting receptors:**\n- Stop firing quickly even if stimulus continues\n- Example: Smell receptors (you stop noticing a scent after 1-2 minutes)\n- Example: Touch receptors (you forget you're wearing clothes)\n\n**Slow-adapting receptors:**\n- Continue firing as long as stimulus is present\n- Example: Nociceptors (pain doesn't disappear if injury continues!)\n- Example: Proprioceptors (you always know where your limbs are)\n\n**Survival Advantage:**\n- Fast adaptation: Frees up brain power \u2014 no need to constantly process unchanging stimuli\n- Slow adaptation: Keeps critical info active (pain warns you to protect injury)",

          "body": "**Remember the challenge?** How do you detect different types of threats (fire, break-in, motion, smoke) across a 100-room building?\n\n**The Answer: Option B** \u2014 Install SPECIALIZED sensors throughout the building \u2014 each type detects ONE specific thing (heat sensors for fire, motion sensors for movement, etc.)\n\n**Why this works (and the others don't):**\n\n\u274c **Option A (one universal sensor):** There's no such thing as a universal sensor that detects EVERYTHING with equal accuracy. Heat sensors don't detect motion. Glass-break sensors don't detect smoke. You need specialized tools.\n\n\u2705 **Option B (specialized sensors):** Just like the body uses specialized receptors (thermoreceptors for heat, mechanoreceptors for sound, chemoreceptors for smoke), a security system uses specialized sensors. Each sensor is optimized for ONE type of threat, ensuring nothing is missed.\n\nThis is EXACTLY how your body works:\n- \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Photoreceptors (eyes) detect light \u2192 vision\n- \ud83d\udc42 Mechanoreceptors (ears) detect sound \u2192 hearing\n- \ud83d\udc43 Chemoreceptors (nose) detect chemicals \u2192 smell\n- \ud83d\udc45 Chemoreceptors (tongue) detect dissolved chemicals \u2192 taste\n- \ud83d\udd90\ufe0f Mechanoreceptors + thermoreceptors (skin) \u2192 touch and temperature\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Nociceptors (throughout body) \u2192 pain warnings\n- \ud83e\ude7a Internal chemoreceptors (pancreas, blood) \u2192 glucose, oxygen, CO\u2082 monitoring\n\n\u274c **Option C (walk around constantly):** Too slow! By the time you manually check every room, the fire has spread or the intruder has escaped. Receptors provide INSTANT, continuous monitoring.\n\n\u274c **Option D (wait for visible damage):** Reactive, not proactive. Homeostasis works because receptors detect SMALL changes EARLY (slight temperature rise, minor glucose increase) before they become dangerous.\n\n---\n\n**The Receptor Principle:**\n\n**Specialization = Sensitivity**\n\nBy having receptors dedicated to ONE stimulus type, your body achieves incredible detection abilities:\n- Photoreceptors can detect a SINGLE photon of light\n- Chemoreceptors can detect one molecule of odor chemical among billions of air molecules\n- Mechanoreceptors can detect vibrations smaller than a human hair's width\n\nIf you tried to build one 'universal receptor,' it wouldn't be good at ANY of these tasks.\n\n---\n\n**Receptors: The Unsung Heroes**\n\nYou have BILLIONS of receptors constantly monitoring:\n- **External world:** Light, sound, temperature, chemicals, touch, pain\n- **Internal world:** Blood glucose, oxygen, CO\u2082, pH, blood pressure, body temperature, water balance\n\nEvery second, they're converting stimuli into electrical signals, sending status reports to your brain and control centers. Without them:\n- \u274c No homeostasis (can't detect changes to respond to)\n- \u274c No senses (can't see, hear, smell, taste, feel)\n- \u274c No survival (can't detect threats, hunger, thirst, damage)\n\nReceptors are the FOUNDATION of every response your body makes.\n\n---\n\n**Next Mission:** Now that you understand the surveillance network (receptors), we'll explore CENTRAL COMMAND \u2014 the nervous system that processes all these signals and coordinates lightning-fast responses.",
