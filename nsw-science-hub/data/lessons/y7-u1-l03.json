The QUESTION STRUCTURE does!\n\nYou can ask non-scientific questions about 'sciencey' topics:\n❌ 'Which element is the coolest?' (opinion about science)\n\nYou can ask scientific questions about 'everyday' topics:\n✅ 'Which cookie recipe produces the crispiest texture?' (measurable food science)\n\n**What Makes a Question Scientific:**\n1. Has measurable variables\n2. Can be tested with evidence\n3. Others can verify your results\n4.
