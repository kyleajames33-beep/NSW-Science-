Maybe the large wings didn't help at all - maybe it was just the harder throw, or the outdoor wind, or the extra height!\n\n**How to Make it FAIR:**\n\n**Independent Variable:** Wing size (small vs large) - this is what you're testing\n\n**Dependent Variable:** Distance flown (measured in meters)\n\n**Controlled Variables (must ALL be the same):**\n• Same person throwing\n• Same throwing force (measured throw speed)\n• Same location (all indoors OR all outdoors)\n• Same release height (all from shoulder OR all from overhead)\n• Same airplane body design\n• Same paper type and weight\n• Same launch angle\n• No wind conditions\n• Multiple trials of each (e.g., 5 throws per design)\n\n**Proper Prediction:**\n'I predict that the paper airplane with larger wings will fly farther than the small-wing design because larger wing surface area creates more lift force, allowing the plane to stay airborne longer and travel greater distances.'\n\n**The Science Lesson:**\nWhen you change multiple variables at once, you can't isolate causes. Your conclusion becomes INVALID. Fair testing means:\n✅ Change ONE variable (independent)\n✅ Measure ONE outcome (dependent)  \n✅ Control EVERYTHING ELSE (constants)\n✅ Repeat multiple times (trials)\n\nThat's how real scientists work! 🔬"
