          "explanation": "**Correct Answer: Insulin Resistance (Type 2 Diabetes)**\n\nIn Type 2 diabetes, the pancreas produces insulin, but cells don't respond to it properly — they've become RESISTANT. It's like knocking on a door that won't open. The insulin is there, but cells don't absorb glucose efficiently.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n- **Too much sugar:** While diet affects blood glucose levels, even normal meals cause problems in diabetes because the underlying issue is the cells' response to insulin, not just sugar intake.\n- **Insulin too slow:** The pancreas actually produces insulin at normal speed; the problem is the cells' resistance to it.\n- **Liver overproduction:** While the liver does release glucose, the main issue in Type 2 is insulin resistance, not excessive liver glucose release.",
