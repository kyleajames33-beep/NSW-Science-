The thermostat:\n- **Detects** current temperature (receptor)\n- **Compares** to set point (22°C — control center)\n- **Responds** by turning heater on/off (effector)\n- **Stops** when set point is reached (prevents overcorrection)\n\nThis is why your body doesn't constantly shiver and sweat at the same time — it only activates responses when needed, then stops when balance is restored.\n\n❌ **Option C (weather forecast):** The body doesn't predict the future — it REACTS to changes as they happen. What if the forecast is wrong? What if you suddenly start exercising? Feedback loops handle unpredictability.\n\n❌ **Option D (match outside temp):** This defeats the whole purpose! Your body maintains 37°C whether you're in Antarctica or the Sahara. Homeostasis means RESISTING external changes, not matching them.\n\n---\n\n**The Big Idea:**\nYour body is running hundreds of thermostats simultaneously — for temperature, glucose, pH, water, oxygen, and more. Each one uses negative feedback to keep conditions stable despite a chaotic, unpredictable world.\n\n**This is why you can:**\n- Eat a massive meal (blood sugar spike) and feel normal an hour later\n- Jump into a cold pool and maintain 37°C body temperature\n- Run a marathon and stay alive despite extreme stress on every system\n\nHomeostasis is the silent guardian keeping you alive every second of every day.\n\n---\n\n**Next Mission:** Now that you understand the body's thermostat, we'll explore the SENSORS that detect changes — the surveillance network of receptors that make homeostasis possible.",
