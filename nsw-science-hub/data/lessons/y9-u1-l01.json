          "body": "**Remember the challenge?** A thermostat trying to maintain 22\u00b0C despite wildly changing outside temperatures.\n\n**The Answer: Option B** \u2014 Monitor the room temperature constantly, turn heater ON when too cold, turn heater OFF when too hot.\n\n**Why this works (and the others don't):**\n\n\u274c **Option A (constant medium power):** This might work if conditions were perfectly predictable, but when outside temp changes randomly, constant power will either overheat or undercool the room.\n\n\u2705 **Option B (negative feedback):** This is EXACTLY how homeostasis works! The thermostat:\n- **Detects** current temperature (receptor)\n- **Compares** to set point (22\u00b0C \u2014 control center)\n- **Responds** by turning heater on/off (effector)\n- **Stops** when set point is reached (prevents overcorrection)\n\nThis is why your body doesn't constantly shiver and sweat at the same time \u2014 it only activates responses when needed, then stops when balance is restored.\n\n\u274c **Option C (weather forecast):** The body doesn't predict the future \u2014 it REACTS to changes as they happen. What if the forecast is wrong? What if you suddenly start exercising? Feedback loops handle unpredictability.\n\n\u274c **Option D (match outside temp):** This defeats the whole purpose! Your body maintains 37\u00b0C whether you're in Antarctica or the Sahara. Homeostasis means RESISTING external changes, not matching them.\n\n---\n\n**The Big Idea:**\nYour body is running hundreds of thermostats simultaneously \u2014 for temperature, glucose, pH, water, oxygen, and more. Each one uses negative feedback to keep conditions stable despite a chaotic, unpredictable world.\n\n**This is why you can:**\n- Eat a massive meal (blood sugar spike) and feel normal an hour later\n- Jump into a cold pool and maintain 37\u00b0C body temperature\n- Run a marathon and stay alive despite extreme stress on every system\n\nHomeostasis is the silent guardian keeping you alive every second of every day.\n\n---\n\n**Next Mission:** Now that you understand the body's thermostat, we'll explore the SENSORS that detect changes \u2014 the surveillance network of receptors that make homeostasis possible.",
